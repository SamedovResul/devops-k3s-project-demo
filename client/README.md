## 🚀 CI/CD Workflow

GitHub Actions automates Docker image builds and deployment:

### 🛠 CI (Build)

- Triggered on push to `production` branch
- Builds Docker image using a multi-stage Dockerfile
- Pushes both `:latest` and `:sha` tags to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**

### 🚀 CD (Deploy)

- Authenticates to K3s using a stored `kubeconfig` secret
- Uses `kubectl set image` to update the live deployment
- Performs a rollout restart
